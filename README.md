# Housing

This is going to be a database for large panel system-buildings (Plattenbauten) in Germany, currently work-in-progress (or rather under construction).

It is based on the following technologies:

- Next.js 13
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 3
- Github Actions
- Prisma & PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

### 2. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **yarn** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`.
